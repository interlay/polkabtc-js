## About

The interbtc TypeScript library connects the Polkadot ecosystem with Bitcoin. It allows the creation of interBTC, a fungible token that represents Bitcoin in the Polkadot ecosystem. InterBTC is backed by Bitcoin 1:1 and allows redeeming of the equivalent amount of Bitcoins by relying on a collateralized third-party (Vaults).
In comparison to other bridge constructions (like tBTC, wBTC, or RenVM) _anyone_ can become an intermediary by depositing collateral making interBTC the only truly open system.

The bridge itself follows the detailed specification: <a href="https://interlay.gitlab.io/interbtc-spec/" target="_blank"><strong>Explore the specification »</strong></a>

It is implemented as a collection of open-source Substrate modules using Rust: <a href="https://github.com/interlay/interbtc" target="_blank"><strong>Explore the implementation »</strong></a>

### Built with

- [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript)
- [polkadot-js](https://polkadot.js.org/)
- [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn)
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

You can visit [bridge.interlay.io](https://bridge.interlay.io/) to see the library in action.

## Usage

The library assumes you have a [BTC-Parachain](https://github.com/interlay/interbtc) running locally or remotely.

### Creating an API Instance

To use the library, you will first need to create a PolkadotJS `APIPromise` instance,
and then to instantiate a `InterBTCAPI` instance.

```ts
import { createInterbtcAPI } from "@interlay/interbtc";

// If you are using a local development environment
// const DEFAULT_PARACHAIN_ENDPOINT = "ws://127.0.0.1:9944";
// if you want to use the Interlay-hosted beta network
const DEFAULT_PARACHAIN_ENDPOINT = "wss://bridge.interlay.io/api/parachain";
const isMainnet = false;
const interBTC = await createInterbtcAPI(DEFAULT_PARACHAIN_ENDPOINT, isMainnet);
```

### Attaching an Account

To emit transactions, an `account` has to be set.
The account should conform to the `AddressOrPair` interface.
If the account is not of the `KeyringPair` type, then a signer must also
be provided (such as an injected extension signer, from the Polkadot wallet).
See more details here: https://polkadot.js.org/docs/extension/usage/

```ts
import { createTestKeyring } from "@polkadot/keyring/testing";
const keyring = createTestKeyring();
const keypair = keyring.getPairs()[0];
interBTC.setAccount(keypair);
```

The different functionalities are then exposed through the `InterBTCAPI` instance.

### Issuing interBTC

From the account you set, you can then start requesting to issue interBTC.

```ts
import { BTCAmount } from "@interlay/monetary-js";
// amount of BTC to convert to interBTC
// NOTE: the bridge fees will be deducted from this. For example, if you request 1 BTC, you will receive about 0.995 interBTC
const amount = BTCAmount.from.BTC(0.001);
// request to issue interBTC
const requestResults = await interBTC.issue.request(amount);
// the request results includes the BTC address(es) and the BTC that should be sent to the vault(s)
// NOTE: the library will automatically distribute issue requests across multiple vaults if no single vault can fulfill the request.
// Most of the time, a single vault will be able to fulfill the request.
```

At this point, you will need to send BTC using your favorite BTC wallet.

### Redeeming interBTC

```ts
import { BTCAmount } from "@interlay/monetary-js";
// the amount interBTC to burn
// NOTE: the bridge fees will be deducted from this 
const amount = BTCAmount.from.BTC(0.001);
// your BTC address
const btcAddress = "tb123....";
// the request results includes the BTC address(es) and the BTC that should be sent to the vault(s)
// NOTE: the library will automatically distribute redeem requests across multiple vaults if no single vault can fulfill the request.
// Most of the time, a single vault will be able to fulfill the request.
const requestResults = await interBTC.redeem.request(amount, btcAddress);
```

At this point, one more more vaults will send BTC to the address specified within 24 hours.

### More Examples

There are plenty more examples how to use this library. Best is to take a look at the integration tests: https://github.com/interlay/interbtc-js/tree/13b421bb0fb91a04ce671e15a6be860750cc08a2/test/integration/parachain

## API Documentation

Please check the documentation at https://www.interlay.io/interbtc-js/#/modules

## Development

### Clone this Repository

```bash
git@gitlab.com:interlay/interbtc-js.git
cd interbtc-js
```

### Setting up a Local Development Environment

You can spin up the parachain including the different clients with docker-compose:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

If you want to run components individually, you can clone the repositories and run the commands as done in `docker-compose.yml`.

To install dependencies, run

```bash
yarn install
```

Build the library using

```bash
yarn build
```

### Testing

To run only unit tests, use

```bash
yarn test:unit
```

Note that the parachain needs to be running for all tests to pass.

Then, to run tests, run

```bash
yarn test
```

Certain API calls require a parameter of type `AccountId`, which represents the Polkadot/Kusama account and can be instantiated as follows

```ts
import { AccountId } from "@polkadot/types/interfaces/runtime";

const activeStakedRelayerId = await interBTC.api.createType(
    "AccountId",
    "5Ck5SLSHYac6WFt5UZRSsdJjwmpSZq85fd5TRNAdZQVzEAPT"
);
const feesEarnedByActiveStakedRelayer = await interBTC.stakedRelayer.getFeesEarned(
    activeStakedRelayerId
);
```

### Updating Types

Run the parachain (or indeed any Substrate node) and download the metadata:

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":"1", "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "state_getMetadata", "params":[]}' http://localhost:9933 > src/json/parachain.json
```

Then, update the metadata by building the library:

```bash
yarn build
```

## Help

### Bitcoin Regtest

Regtest is a local Bitcoin instance that allows you to practically anything including sending transactions, mining blocks, and generating new addresses.
For a full overview, [head over to the Bitcoin developer documentation](https://developer.bitcoin.org/examples/testing.html#regtest-mode).

**Sending Transactions**

For the issue process, you need to send a transaction. On regtest this can be achieved with:

```shell
bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcwallet=Alice sendtoaddress VAULT_ADDRESS AMOUNT
```

**Mining Blocks**

In regtest, blocks are not automatically produced. After you sent a transaction, you need to mine e.g., 1 block:

```shell
bitcoin-cli -regtest generatetoaddress 1 $(bitcoin-cli -regtest getnewaddress)
```

**Getting Balances**

You can query the balance of your wallet like so:

```shell
bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcwallet=Alice getbalance
```

### Docker

You can hard-reset the docker dependency setup with the following commands:

```shell
docker kill $(docker ps -q)
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
docker rmi $(docker images -q)
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q)
```
